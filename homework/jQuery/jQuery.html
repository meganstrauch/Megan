          <p> Exuma is a district of the Bahamas, consisting of over 365 islands. Its beautiful white sand beaches and
            turquoise waters make it a world-famous destination. If you have the possibility to charter a
            boat and sail around to the different islands for a few days, that is the ultimate way to
            experience the Exuma islands. But since it is becoming a more popular vacation destination there
            are also houses to rent on a few of the different islands, which will give you an amazing island
            life and sea life experience as well. A few of my favorite islands are Staniel Cay, Highborne cay, and Wax Cay.</p>

        <div id="set2" class="text b">
          <img src="img/conch.jpg" alt="conch" style= "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
          <p> If you visit The Exumas Islands in the Bahamas you have to try conch. Conch is the national food of
            The Bahamas and a true Bahamian specialty.  It  is used in a lot of different way in different traditional
            Bahamian diches, like steamed or deep-fried, or even served raw with citrus juices and fresh vegetables.
            A few of most popular conch dishes are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a>Conch salad </a></li>
              <li><a>Conch fritters  </a></li>
              <li><a>Cracked conch  </a></li>
              <li><a>Cracked conch sandwich  </a></li>
              <li><a>Conch Chowder</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="set3" class="text c">
          <img src="img/pig.jpg" alt="pig" style= "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
          <p> Big Major Cay is the home to the famous Pig Island, Pig Beach. If you are in the Exumas you have
            to visit this beach. The Exuma Pigs beach is a very unique attraction that has become very popular
            over the years. You will be able to watch the pigs swim, swim amongst them and even feed them and pet them.
            There are usually even little baby piglets that you can play with. </p>

        <div id="set4" class="text d">
          <img src="img/cave.jpg" alt="cave" style= "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
          <p> There are a lot of beautiful caves in the Exuam Islands. One that is very famous, and that I think
            is one of the most beautiful ones it the Thunderball cave. The Thunderball cave is located just west of
            Staniel Cay, very close to the Pig Beach. This fantastic underwater cave system is great for diving,
            snorkeling, and wading. It has amazing marine life, with lots of reefs and fishes, both inside and outside
            the cave. This cave got is name from the 1965 James Bond spy film “Thunderball”, which was shot inside the
            cave. </p>

        <div id="set5" class="text e">
          <img src="img/sharks.jpg" alt="sharks" style= "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
          <p> Nurse sharks, the bottom-dwelling sharks that live in warm, shallow waters of the Bahamas are a
            friendly bunch. Compass Cay in the Exumas hold a number of sharks that the islanders consider welcome guests.
             At Compass Cay the sharks are known to be well-fed and behaved. If you are in the Exumas this is another must.
             At Compass Cay you will get the experience to fed, pet and swim with nurse sharks. A unforgettable experience. </p>
